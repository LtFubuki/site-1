<p>Dear Crook County Residents,</p>

<p>My name is Eddy Howard, and I am excited to announce my candidacy for the Crook County School Board - SW Zone 4 position in the upcoming election. I am eager to share my background, beliefs, and the key issues I will focus on if I have the privilege of serving on the board. As we move forward in this election season, I would like to emphasize that I hold no ill will towards current board members or other potential candidates. I am grateful for your support, but kindly request that you refrain from making any monetary donations. However, if you would like to show your support through a yard sign, please reach out to me, and I will make arrangements as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As a candidate, I am dedicated to addressing three main concerns:</p>

<p>Fiscal Responsibility, Transparency, and Taxpayer Involvement: I believe it is crucial for all stakeholders to have easy access to information regarding the school district's finances. This includes upcoming projects and operating costs, which should be well-documented and readily available for public review. In addition, I will work to involve taxpayers in the decision-making process to ensure that their voices are heard and considered.</p>

<p>Elimination of Distractions from Learning: It is essential to maintain a focus on the core objective of education &ndash; preparing students for success in the workforce, higher education, trade schools, and life in general. I will work to minimize any distractions that may hinder the teaching and learning process, allowing educators to concentrate on their primary responsibilities and ensuring that students receive the best education possible.</p>

<p>Expansion and Improvement of After-School Sports Programs and Facilities: I believe it is time for our district to modernize and upgrade our sports facilities. By collaborating with external resources, such as local businesses and organizations, we can secure funding and support to achieve these goals. The growth of our after-school sports programs will provide additional opportunities for students to learn teamwork, discipline, and other essential life skills.</p>

<p>As for my background, I was born in a small town called Five Rivers on the Oregon Coast near Florence. My family moved to Prineville in 1977 after my mother, Helen Howard, married my stepfather, Bud Howard. He later adopted my brother, Brian, and me, and we took his last name. I attended Crook County schools from first grade through twelfth grade, graduating from Crook County High School in 1991.</p>

<p>After high school, I joined the Marine Corps in 1992 and returned to Prineville in 1996 following a medical discharge. I then worked in the IT department at Les Schwab Tires for approximately eleven years. Currently, I am employed at PrineTIME Internet Solutions, right here in Prineville. I am married to my lovely wife, Tonya, who is employed by the Crook County School District. Together, we have two wonderful sons, Cameron and Brogan, who are both engaged to be married.</p>

<p>As we approach the election, I am committed to answering any questions you may have and engaging in meaningful dialogue with members of our community. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with your concerns or inquiries.</p>

<p>I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration. I am looking forward to the opportunity to serve the Crook County School District and our community.</p>

<p>Warm Regards, Eddy Howard</p>
